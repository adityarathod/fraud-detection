# Credit Card Fraud Detection (work in progress)

*Created as a learning project within the 
[Clark Summer Research Program](https://honors.utdallas.edu/clark-summer-research-program)
at the University of Texas at Dallas.*

## About this Model
This model is a single-layer neural network, with the architecture as follows:

```text
Model: "sequential"
_________________________________________________________________
Layer (type)                 Output Shape              Param #   
=================================================================
dense (Dense)                (None, 5)                 150       
_________________________________________________________________
dense_1 (Dense)              (None, 1)                 6         
=================================================================
Total params: 156
Trainable params: 156
Non-trainable params: 0
_________________________________________________________________

```


The first `Dense` layer has a ReLU activation function, and the output layer has a `Sigmoid` activation function. 

## Performance
This model performs with 99.99% accuracy on the test set, as generated through a deterministic random shuffle of the original dataset.

This model also does relatively well when evaluated on other metrics, such as F‚ÇÅ score (0.77-0.80 on the test set). 
A higher score is not practically achievable due to the imbalance between positive and negative examples within the dataset (there are much fewer fraud transactions vs. non-fraud).

## Install
`virtualenv env; source env/bin/activate`


`pip install -r requirements.txt`

`python main.py`
